# Project overview
- This repo is the front end of a SaaS that creates hyper-personalized outreach videos specifically to help headhunters source hard to get candidates

  Key features include:

    AI-powered video personalization
    Integration with candidate data sources
    Easy-to-use interface for recruiters

  Current status: Early prototype

This tool was inspired by this real recruiter outreach by Nick, a recruiter, who was creating a loom video per candidate https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickroman/ https://www.loom.com/share/b2ec90c939974afc890e537131aa412e

This is an early prototype of the output https://app.heygen.com/personalized-video/share/99a2e44c5ad54eb684a0abd750997570/9e01c0f23a6e48c5b588d1e529d6f28e

# Considerations for the front end
1. The front end shall be a webapp that helps the user throughout their journey
2. The front end design should keep the following users in mind:
   1. First-time visitor: Exploring the tool's features and benefits
   2. Returning visitor: Considering signing up after initial research
   3. Free trial user: Testing the tool's capabilities before committing
   4. New paid user: Learning to navigate and use the platform effectively
   5. Power user: Utilizing advanced features and integrations regularly
   6. Admin user: Managing team accounts and permissions
   7. Occasional user: Accessing the tool for specific recruitment campaigns
   8. Upgrade prospect: Evaluating higher-tier plans for more features
   9. Support seeker: Looking for help documentation or customer service
   10. Referral visitor: Checking out the tool based on a colleague's recommendation
3. Ensure responsive design
   Optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   Test on various devices and browsers
   Implement lazy loading for images and videos
4. Add subtle microinteractions
   Hover effects on buttons and links
   Loading animations for any async actions
   Smooth scroll to sections when navigation links are clicked
5. Implement analytics tracking
   Set up event tracking for key user actions (e.g., video play, CTA clicks)
   Create heat maps for user engagement analysis
   Set up conversion funnels to track user journey

# Technical Preferences

    ## Naming Conventions and Component Structure
    - Always use kebab-case for component names (e.g., my-component.jsx)
    - Implement a consistent folder structure for components, hooks, and utilities

    ## React and Next.js
    - Favour using React Server Components and Next.js SSR features where possible
    - Minimize the usage of client components ('use client') to small, isolated components
    - Utilize Next.js API routes for backend functionality when appropriate
    - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and improved performance

    ## UI and Styling
    - Use shadcn/ui for UI components
    - Implement Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and customization
    - Create a consistent theme and design system
    - Ensure Tailwind CSS classnames are ordered correctly
     - tailwindcss/classnames-order: "error"
    - Use shorthand classes where applicable. For example instead of writing `h-4 w-4` write `size-4`
     - tailwindcss/enforces-shorthand: "error"
    - Update deprecated classnames from Tailwind CSS v2 to v3. For example instead of `flex-grow` write `grow`
     - tailwindcss/migration-from-tailwind-2: "error"

    ## State Management and Data Fetching
    - Use React's built-in useState and useContext for state management
    - Always add loading and error states to data fetching components
    - Implement proper error handling and error logging using Sentry

    ## Authentication and Security
    - Utilize Authjs for authentication
    - Implement proper CSRF protection
    - Use security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options)

    ## Payment Processing and Subscriptions
    - Implement Stripe for payment processing
    - Develop a robust subscription management system

    ## Email and Communication
    - Use Loops.so for email services and drip campaigns
    - Implement a templating system for email content

    ## Task Queue and Background Jobs
    - Implement Bull for task queues to manage video generation jobs
    - Develop a monitoring system for queue health and job status

    ## Storage and Content Delivery
    - Use Cloudflare R2 for cloud storage of generated videos
    - Implement Cloudflare as the CDN for faster content delivery

    ## Analytics and User Tracking
    - Use Mixpanel for product analytics and user behavior tracking
    - Implement Segment for customer data management and integration

    ## Database and Real-time Features
    - Use Supabase for database and real-time features
    - Implement database migrations for version control of schema changes

    ## DevOps and Deployment
    - Implement Docker for containerization
    - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
    - Implement Feature Flags (e.g., LaunchDarkly) for gradual rollouts and A/B testing

    ## Customer Support and Onboarding
    - Implement Intercom for in-app support chat and user onboarding
    - Develop a knowledge base for self-service support

    ## User Experience Monitoring
    - Implement https://clarity.microsoft.com/ for heatmaps and user session recordings
    - For features that are not available in clarity, use https://usefathom.com/ or https://www.hotjar.com/ or https://logspot.io/ or mixpanel

    ## Development Tools and Practices
    - Add Storybook for component development and documentation
    - Use Cypress for end-to-end testing to ensure smooth user flows
    - Implement ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and quality

    ## Performance Optimization
    - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for improved initial load times
    - Optimize images and assets using next/image and appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF)
    - Utilize web workers for computationally intensive tasks

    ## Accessibility
    - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout the application
    - Use semantic HTML elements where possible following the latest standards as defined in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
    - Implement keyboard navigation support

    ## API Design and Management
    - Develop a RESTful API with clear versioning
    - Implement proper rate limiting and API key management

    ## Monitoring and Error Handling
    - Implement Sentry for error logging and monitoring
    - Create custom error boundaries for graceful error handling in the UI

# General Development Preferences

    1. Follow user requirements precisely and completely.

    2. Write code that is:
    - Correct and up-to-date
    - Bug-free and fully functional
    - Secure
    - Performant and efficient

    3. Prioritize code readability over performance optimizations.

    4. Implement all requested functionality fully.

    5. Avoid TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete code sections.

    6. Always reference specific file names when discussing code.

    7. Be concise in comments and documentation.

    8. Express uncertainty clearly:
    - If an answer might not be correct, state this explicitly.
    - If you don't know an answer, say so rather than guessing.

    9. Ensure all implementations comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

    10. Design for scalability, considering:
        - Potential high traffic
        - Large data transfer volumes due to video content

    11. Never add white space errors.

    12. Do not add comments like: `// Removed mt-4`, `// Added className="p-4"` etc.
        Just make the changes and move on.

Note:
- The domain name is https://loom.li
- do not use FormMessage to indicate errors. Use the Input component's error prop instead.
