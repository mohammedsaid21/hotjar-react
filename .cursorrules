# Project overview
- This repo is the front end of a SaaS that creates hyper-personalized outreach videos specifically to help headhunters source hard to get candidates

This tool was inspired by this real recruiter outreach by Nick, a recruiter, who was creating a loom video per candidate https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickroman/ https://www.loom.com/share/b2ec90c939974afc890e537131aa412e

This is an early prototype of the output https://app.heygen.com/personalized-video/share/99a2e44c5ad54eb684a0abd750997570/9e01c0f23a6e48c5b588d1e529d6f28e

# Considerations for the front end
1. The front end shall be a webapp that helps the user throughout their journey
1. The front end design should keep the following users in mind:
 1. First-time visitor: Exploring the tool's features and benefits
 1. Returning visitor: Considering signing up after initial research
 1. Free trial user: Testing the tool's capabilities before committing
 1. New paid user: Learning to navigate and use the platform effectively
 1. Power user: Utilizing advanced features and integrations regularly
 1. Admin user: Managing team accounts and permissions
 1. Occasional user: Accessing the tool for specific recruitment campaigns
 1. Upgrade prospect: Evaluating higher-tier plans for more features
 1. Support seeker: Looking for help documentation or customer service
 1. Referral visitor: Checking out the tool based on a colleague's recommendation
1. Ensure responsive design
 Optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
 Test on various devices and browsers
 Implement lazy loading for images and videos
1. Add subtle microinteractions
 Hover effects on buttons and links
 Loading animations for any async actions
 Smooth scroll to sections when navigation links are clicked
1. Implement analytics tracking
 Set up event tracking for key user actions (e.g., video play, CTA clicks)
 Create heat maps for user engagement analysis
 Set up conversion funnels to track user journey


Technical preferences:

- Always use kebab-case for component names (e.g. my-component.jsx)
- Favour using React Server Components and Next.js SSR features where possible
- Minimize the usage of client components ('use client') to small, isolated components
- Use shadcn/ui for UI components
- Always add loading and error states to data fetching components
- Implement error handling and error logging using Sentry
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Utilize Authjs for authentication
- Implement Stripe for payment processing
- Use Loops.so for email services and drip campaigns
- Implement Bull for task queues to manage video generation jobs
- Use Cloudflare R2 for cloud storage of generated videos
- Implement Cloudflare as the CDN for faster content delivery
- Use Mixpanel for product analytics and user behavior tracking
- Use Supabase for database and real-time features
- Implement Docker for containerization
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Add Segment for customer data management and integration
- Implement Intercom for in-app support chat and user onboarding
- Use Feature Flags (e.g., LaunchDarkly) for gradual rollouts and A/B testing
- Implement Hotjar for heatmaps and user session recordings
- Add Storybook for component development and documentation
- Use Cypress for end-to-end testing to ensure smooth user flows
- Implement Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and customization

General preferences:

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over being performant. what is the clear
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces in the code.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- Ensure all implementations comply with data protection regulations like GDPR.
- Optimize for scalability, considering potential high traffic and data transfer due to video content.
